# CSE216 Team Tin Repository
This is the repository where all the work for "Team Tin" from CSE 216 Spring 2020 will be committed into.

## Front End
Front end set up in TypeScript with the React library.

To get it running, go into thhe `web front-end` directory and run `npm install`.
After that run `npm start` from the same directory to start the front end which
will directly open the app in browser in [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

The good thing about how things are set up is that, you can edit your code in 
`App.tsx` and the browser will do a `live update` and you will see your change 
right away when you save the code in `App.tsx`.

## Back End
Backend is setup on Java with the Spark framework similar to what had been implemented for `phase0` in class.
